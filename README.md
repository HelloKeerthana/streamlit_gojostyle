mostly all streamlit syntaxes being made into a tuto?? yeah ig
<h1>my streamlit adventure: embracing the infinite void ðŸŒŒ</h1>

<p>yo, welcome to my streamlit project! here, i merged python, machine learning, and a little bit of gojo satoru's limitless power into a fun, interactive app. itâ€™s like stepping into the void, but with sliders and buttons!</p>

<h2>what is streamlit?</h2>
<p>think of it as a magic wand for building web apps with python. no crazy front-end stuffâ€”just pure python! and i used it to bring gojo's domain expansion to life.</p>

<h2>dark mode vibes</h2>
<p>i kicked things off with a dark mode toggle because, well, why not? the infinite void looks better in the dark.</p>

<h2>interactive fun</h2>
<p>you can control your energy, choose your gojo technique (blue, red, hollow purple), and even get predictions from a machine learning model. endless fun!</p>

<h2>wave energy vibes</h2>
<p>of course, no experience would be complete without a dynamic energy wave. feel the limitless energy flow with each plot!</p>

<h2>upload your vibes</h2>
<p>upload your favorite anime image (gojo, maybe?) and feel the power of infinity right in your app.</p>

<h2>the void is endless</h2>
<p>streamlit made this journey super fun. now, itâ€™s your turn to dive in and explore the infinite possibilities!</p>
